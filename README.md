# DroneSeek
Welcome to my machine learning project! The end goal of this project is to build an AI model that can detect UAV drones using audio and visual data (sensor fusion), and perhaps even be able to classify what type of drone it is seeing. Right now, the project is in its early stages: data sourcing and preprocessing is being hashed out and a simpler convolutional neural network working as a binary classifier will be implemented to begin with, just as a prototype to screen for potential problems with data formats and so on.
