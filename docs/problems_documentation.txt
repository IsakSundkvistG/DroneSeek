1) UrbanSound8k comes in ten pre-sorted folds for which the data is correlated inside each respective
fold but independent from other folds --> must pay attention to this when doing k-fold cross-val as 
cross validating on randomly mixed set will use "seen" data as test data. 

Solution: Keep UrbanSound8k separately sorted in their given folds (as in download). Then take all
other data, shuffle and split it randomly into ten folds, then insert that data into the UrbanSound8k
folds. Use that split for cross-validation!

2) Different length of wav files --> spectrograms with different length black blocks when zero-padding. 
Could maybe cause problems with learning, CNN might learn 'drones come at beginning of image' and 
things of the like. 

Solution: Add a mask channel to each spectrogram where it is just ones for where the signal is 
and zeros for black blocks. Telling the CNN what is a signal and what isn't.
